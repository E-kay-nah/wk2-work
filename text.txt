What distinguishes normal HTML elements from semantic HTML elements?

   A semantic html element clearly describes its meaning and content to both the browser
   and the developer e.g (<form>, <table>, <article>), while the normal html elements tells
   nothing about its content e.g(<div>, <span>).

Explain the disparity between closing tags and self closing tag?

     A self closing tag is a tag that does not need to be closed manually by its closing 
     tag,which means that the tags have no content and cannot have any children. e.g <br>,<hr>,
     <input>,<img>,<meta> while 
     Closing tags needs a closing tag and also child elements exists
     in closing tag e.g <p>,<div>,<h1>,<h2>.

Differences between inline elements and block elements?
    A block level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add 
    some space (margin) before and after the element and always takes up the full width available
    e.g <p>,<div>,<header>,<article>. while
    Inline elements does not start on a new line .An inline element only takes as much width 
    as necessary e.g <span>,<a>,<i>,<br>
